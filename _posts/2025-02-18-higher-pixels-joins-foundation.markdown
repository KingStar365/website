Today we are happy to announce that <a href="https://www.higherpixels.com/">Higher Pixels</a>, the team behind the popular podcast platform <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/">Buzzsprout</a>, is joining the Rails Foundation as a Contributing member!

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-higherpixels-color.svg" style="width: 45%"></p>

Higher Pixels has been building with Rails since 2005, and since then has launched five products - all while adhering to the Rails Doctrine and using as close to 100% vanilla Rails as possible. Buzzsprout is now their largest product, and the most well-known in the Rails community. Today, it serves over 100,000 podcasts on a robust Rails monolith - a great example of how you don’t need much else in your toolbox to scale a large, public-facing Rails platform.

>In the history of our company, nothing has impacted our ability to build and scale product ideas like Ruby on Rails - the framework, the doctrine, and the community. Rails has given us the foundation to turn ideas into successful products, enabling us to move fast while keeping our code elegant and maintainable. It has shaped not just how we build software, but how we think about development as a craft.
>Beyond the technology, the Rails community has been an incredible source of knowledge, support, and inspiration. The openness and generosity of Rails developers have helped us grow, and we’re excited to give back by joining the Rails Foundation. We believe in supporting the community that has given us so much, ensuring it continues to thrive for years to come.

Higher Pixels has already been a supporter of the work we do at the Rails Foundation from day one - they sponsored both <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2023/8/1/host-your-podcast-at-rails-world-with-buzzsprout">Rails World 2023</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/7/15/launch-your-podcast-at-rails-world">2024</a>, and will be at Rails World 2025 again with their on-site podcast studio. So we are happy that they have taken this extra step to be a yearlong partner. 

Their support will help us continue fulfilling our mission to support current Rails devs and welcome new Rails devs into the community.

Stay tuned for more details on how to apply to the Buzzsprout podcast program at Rails World 2025!
